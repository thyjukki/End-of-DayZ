	// README
	// for my convenience I will explain how the ammo is configured
	// class name consists of the basename for example 9x18_x
	// You add number after the x indicating the size of the ammo stack (like 9x18_x10)
	// correct stack amounts are 1-10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100
	// so 9x18_x5 is correct, but 9x18_x15 is not
	// Id recomend having something along lines of 5 to 10 stacks common, have 20 rounds maximum that can spawn (rare) and 1 to 4 being uncomon
	// obviously this depends of the weapon
	// TODO(Skippy) I only added x1 variants, you can add more yourself (I am lazy)
