ADDON DESCRIPTION
=================

This addon will add six variants of the Accuracy International L115A3 sniper rifle to
ArmA 2. Including supressed and unsupressed rifles in three different colour schemes:
woodland (green & brown painted), desert (tan & brown painted) and an unpainted
'Flat Dark Earth' chassis.

The addon also include a script to simulate a folding bipod. Pressing the H key will
perform this action. This script was originally made by norrin for the Australians at War
'AAW Infantry Weapons Pack' and is used with the expressed consent of norrin and the AAW team

The addon makes use of several features of ACE Mod, including a fully-calibrated ballistics
table for use with the mod's sight-adjustment feature, produced by Q1184; and the ability 
to rest the weapon on its bipod when it is deployed.
